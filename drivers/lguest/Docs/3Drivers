 * Drivers
 *
 * The Guest needs devices to do anything useful.  Since we don't let it touch
 * real devices (think of the damage it could do!) we provide virtual devices.
 * We could emulate a PCI bus with various devices on it, but that is a fairly
 * complex burden for the Host and suboptimal for the Guest, so we have our own
 * simple lguest bus and we use "virtio" drivers.  These drivers need a set of
 * routines from us which will actually do the virtual I/O, but they handle all
 * the net/block/console stuff themselves.  This means that if we want to add
 * a new device, we simply need to write a new virtio driver and create support
 * for it in the Launcher: this code won't need to change.
 *
 * Virtio devices are also used by kvm, so we can simply reuse their optimized
 * device drivers.  And one day when everyone uses virtio, my plan will be
 * complete.  Bwahahahah!
 *
 * Devices are described by a simplified ID, a status byte, and some "config"
 * bytes which describe this device's configuration.  This is placed by the
 * Launcher just above the top of physical memory:
